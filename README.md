# Semantic Discriminability for Visual Communication 

Karen B. Schloss, Zachary Leggon, and Laurent Lessard



Semantic discriminability is the degree to which observers can infer distinct mappings between visual features and concepts, based on the visual features and concepts alone (i.e., without legends or labels). In this project, we define a new metric to quantify semantic discriminability, called semantic distance. We then evaluated whether people's ability to interpret information visualizations was influenced by semantic distance, independent of perceptual distance (i.e., delta E in CIELAB space). The results show that semantic distance influences interpretability independent of perceptual distance, and overrides perceptual distance when the metrics conflict. These results can be used to inform color palette design for information visualizations, and help navigate trade-offs between competing factors (e.g., perceptual distance, semantic distance, name difference, aesthetic preference, affective connotiation).
